:: Aim for the head {"position":"900,3000","size":"100,100"}
You decide to go for Hephaestus' head. You carefully aim the rocket launcher, and let it fly. A brief pause, and a fireball engulfs the beast's maw. You hear Charybdis scream, but the machine does not go down. However, it does not seem to be controlled at the moment. You wonder if Charybdis was killed, but there's notime to dwell on it. You take advantage of the stalled movements to get behind it, and take a shot on the magazine. The rocket strikes true, and Hephaestus is destroyed from the inside out with an ear-splitting ''BOOM!''
[[Hephaestus Destroyed]]


:: C4 takedown {"position":"900,3200","size":"100,100"}
You close the distance on the felled machine, and begin planting the charges. You plant one on each joint, one at the back of the neck, and a final charge where the ammo storage should be. Your work complete, you dramatically walk to the exit, and press the detonator. The entire compound shakes from the blast, and a bit of shrapnel flies past your head.

:: Death {"position":"1400,800","size":"100,100"}
You hear a bang, and your head lights up in agony. Then, as soon as it came, it fades. The world goes dark, and your body goes cold, until eventually, all feeling fades.

YOU DIED

[[Restart?|Start]] 


:: Disarmed {"position":"900,700","size":"100,100"}
(set:$disarmed to true)You leave most of your weapons behind, but keep some smoke grenades, and you crawl through the vent. After a few minutes in the ducts, you reach an opening inside the base.
[[Infiltration]]


:: Enter Charybdis {"position":"900,2600","size":"100,100"}
Leaving the smoldering foundry, you enter a gigantic hangar. Before you is the robot from the blueprints. As you admire the mechanical beast, you hear a smooth voice to your right.

"So, you finally made it, Scylla! I must say, I assumed you'd be quicker."

Your head snaps to the man, your whole body in disbelief. "It can't be... Charybdis?! But... you were killed in Arkansas!"

"Killed? Oh, heavens no! I merely learned the truth of our dear Republic!"

"What do you mean?"

"Why, that they orchestrated the Rustbelt Revolt! Worse yet, they DARE position themselves as //heroes//, 'restoring order' to a land THEY burned! Tell me, can you really stand by those who deliberately destroyed their homeland so they could grab power? That day, me and my men decided we couldn't."

Shocked, you [[call the captain]], demanding answers.


:: Escape {"position":"1300,3200","size":"100,100"}
As fast as you can, you make a run for it through the halls. You don't bother sneaking around, stealth went out the window with that explosion. Dozens of goons try to stop you, but it seems like most of them were asleep 3 minutes ago, so they're ont that hard to get past. Closer to the door, they're far more alert, but you can't waste time on a firefight. Sprinting through the halls, gunfire flying past you, you make a dive through the closing door. Now in the open, you make a mad dash for the foliage. You are able to lose them in the woods, and you lay low until the bombs drop. Afterward, you return to the ruins, and take a motorcycle that survived the blast.
[[Final Choice]]


:: Feds Ending {"position":"1700,3200","size":"100,100"}
You keep all the files on your person, secure and out of sight, as you make a beeline for DC. You go to the Pentagon, claiming you have critical intel that you're willing to exchange for state protection. They agree, and take the plans, before bringing you to temporary lodgings. Later, you leak the Revolt files to the press. The nation is outraged, and New England's allies leave them. In the turmoil, the Feds deploy their first Hephaestus Mk.II. This shocks America, and many warlords swear fealty to the Feds in fear, as well as seeing which way the wind is blowing. Within 5 years, the American Reunification Proclamation is read on the Senate floor, celebrating the end of the warlord period.

THE END


:: Final Choice {"position":"1500,3200","size":"100,100"}
With the weapon destroyed and Charybdis dead, you face one last choice. Do you bring Hephaestus' blueprints, and use them to protect your home? Or do you strike out on your own?
[[My home has always been good to me, I would never betray them!|New York Ending]]
[[They made their choice in the Revolt. If they betrayed the Feds, who's to say I'll fare any better?|Warband Ending]]
[[My loyalty belongs to those trying to restore my home, not some splinter faction!|Feds Ending]]


:: Foundry Escape {"position":"1000,2400","size":"100,100"}
As the steel pours our, the entire foundry is engulfed in the blinding glow of white-hot iron. The chip fab doesn't stand a chance, millions of dollars worth of machines are washed away by the iron tsunami. That sight is nothing next to what happens to the assembly floor. Your nose fills with the noxious fumes of the vaporized conveyor belts. The robots working the floor burst into flames on contact, the capacitors and batteries violently exploding one by one. Lathes, mills, saws, benders and casting machines are all melted by the heat and merged into the wave. You make the difficult chouce to pull your eyes away from the show, and make your escape.


[[Enter Charybdis]]


:: Gate {"position":"700,500","size":"100,100"}
When you reach the gate, you take a look around. The  guards don't seem all too observant, but they'd surely notice a 6'2 woman in full tactical stealth gear plodding through. What do you do?

:: Go for the legs {"position":"1100,3000","size":"100,100"}
You opt to immobilize the monstrous construct with a joint shot. You take aim at the left knee, and the rocket strikes true. The machine makes a sickening lurch to the left, before collapsing on its back. The fall is dramatic enough to strike the ammunition rack, and just as quickly as it fell, the top half is ripped off by the explosive force, and slams into the opposite wall of the hangar.
[[Hephaestus Destroyed]]


:: Hephaestus Destroyed {"position":"1100,3200","size":"100,100"}
You rush for the hangar's exit, and call the Captain.
(click:"call the Captain")[
"Captain, Hephaestus has been destroyed, as have their production capabilities. Now //please// tell me you've got some answers!"

"..."

"...Captain?"

Suddenly, he responds, breathing heavily. "Scylla! It's all true, and they're sending bombers to get rid of the evidence! That base will be wiped off tha map in 5 minutes!"

"Shit! They know I'm the only one in the world with these files!"

"No. They don't know you took them with you, they think you just transmitted from the server. You'll be safe once you leave, but you have to get out of there NOW!"

"Roger that. [[Over and out, Captain.|Escape]]"]



:: Hephaestus Fight {"position":"1000,2800","size":"100,100"}
You look up at Charybdis, unsure of what's going on, but determined to stop him regardless.

"Well, Scylla, if you won't join me... I'll just give Hephaestus here a TEST DRIVE!"

Scrambling up the ladders, he makes his way to the cockpit of the looming beast. With a horrible mechanical whine, followed by hissing pistons, the terrible machine rises on its hind legs, nearly doubling in size from its seated position. 

(if:$disarmed is true)[You reach for a weapon, only to find nothing but the smokes you saved. //I guess it'll have to do//, you think, quickly stuffing down the bone-crushing terror of facing such overwhelming force, let alone //unarmed//.  You throw one between you and the machine, both obscuring Charybdis' view and dispersing the laser weapon. You run past blind-firing machine guns, and make it to the legs.
[[Melee Takedown]]]
(else-if:$wellArmed is true)[You take out a rocket launcher, suddenly very glad you raided that armory. A quick shot to the knees or hip would take it down quickly, but its weapons would still be armed.  Alternatively, you could go for the head, taking out the laser and possibly even Charybdis, but the machine guns may be capable of independent fire, and would rip you to shreds. A direct hit to the magazine would destroy it in one shot, but the blueprints say it's where a human would have their kidneys. Not an easy shot, and you'd have to get behind it to try. What do you do?
[[Go for the legs]]
[[Aim for the head]]
[[Kidney Shot]]]
(else:)[You take out your rifle, feeling massively outgunned, but you still have a fighting chance. One by one, you start shooting at joints, hoping to pierce the hydraulic lines. Eventually, one connects. While you wait for the lines to drain, paralyzing the mech, you throw down your remaining smoke bombs. Now invisible to the targetting systems, you wait for a grinding noise, signifying the last of the hydraulic fluid leaving the system. When you hear it, you dash out of the smoke, pulling out the remaining C4 not used on the foundry.
[[C4 takedown]]]


:: Hephaestus Primer {"position":"1100,1000","size":"100,100"}
On further investigation, you see a file labelled "Hephaestus." All it contains is a video of a shadowy, humanoid figure, with gigantic weapons. When it fires its cannon, the camera shakes, and the hill in the background is flattened. Disturbed, you harden your resolve, and [[continue your mission|Map]].


:: Infiltration {"position":"900,900","size":"100,100"}
You've made it into the base. You should probably radio your commander for orders, and a reminder of the mission objectives.

(click:"radio your commander")["Captain, I've made it into the base. Where do I go?"

"Excellent work, Scylla. Command wants you to to find out exactly what kinds of weapons they have here, extract them if possible, and destroy them if not. To this end, you also must do the same with their blueprints and any other intel, and destroy their industrial capacity."

"Get the files and weapons, destroy the foundry. Got it."

"There should be a terminal nearby with a map. Find it, and handle the targets. Good luck, Scylla. The fate of the nation may ride on your shoulders."

With that, the colonel hangs up. You see the terminal he mentioned about 10 feet to the left.

[[Go to the terminal|Map]]
]


:: Kidney Shot {"position":"1100,3400","size":"100,100"}
You decide to take aim at the magazine. You quickly run between the machine's legs, and crouch down behind it while you line up the shot. Once you're sure you're ontarget, you let the rocket fly, and quickly hit the deck. After an ear splitting ''BANG'', you hear pieces of the machine rain down around you. Standing up, you dust yourself off, before heading to the exit.
[[Hephaestus Destroyed]]


:: Map {"position":"900,1100","size":"100,100"}
You access the terminal, and find the map. The server room is to the right, and the armory is to the left. The two rooms are joined by a corridor, which later branches out to the foundry. Behind the foundry, there is a large room simply labelled "Lair".

[[Investigate the lair|Hephaestus Primer]]
[[What exactly is in this "armory"?|To Armory]]
[[I should get the data before they realize I'm here|To Server Room]]


:: Mass Destruction {"position":"900,2200","size":"100,100"}
Thanking your lucky stars you aided the armory, you plant some C4 on the blast furnaces. Running to higher ground, you activate the detonator. 
[[Watch the fireworks|Foundry Escape]]


:: Melee Takedown {"position":"900,3400","size":"100,100"}
Once you reach the machine, you pull out your boot knife, and start cutting wires and hydraulic lines. Once the legs are rendered immobile, you take the ladder up the back. When you find a panel labelled "Reactor", you use the knife to unscrew it, before cutting all the coolant lines. You climb back down the ladder, and make it to the exit before the meltdown annhililates the entire hangar.
[[Hephaestus Destroyed]]


:: New York Ending {"position":"1700,3100","size":"100,100"}
You opt to head home, as though you don't know what really happened. Keeping the Revolt files wouldn't really benefit you much, and only puts a target on your back. so you hide it in th woods on the way home. Maybe someone finds them, maybe they don't. Whatever happens, it's no longer your problem. 

When you arrive at Manhattan, you inform your superiors that you completed your mission, and were able to extract the blueprints for their secret weapon. Furthermore, you announce your resignation, citing these kinds of mission being "more than you signed up for." 

You never find out what happened to the Captain, but you hope that he managed to escape. Either way, you can rest easy, knowing your homeland is stronger than ever before.

THE END

You throw a clip of ammunition at the wall, and wait. After several seconds, there is no response.

(if:$disarmed is not true)[(set:$disarmed to true, $cautionLevel to 2)You hurriedly ditch all your weapons and jump into the vent, just before a side door opens and the guards flood in. You hold your breath, desperately hoping they don't find you. Eventually, you hear one radio in. 
"There's no one here, but we found some gear. Not ours. We may well have an intruder, go to medium alert."
//Well, that could have gone better. But I'm not dead, and they're not wiping the data, so it'll be fine. Probably.]
(else:)[You frantically climb into the vent, making it in right before the guards do. As you crawl through the vent, you hear them milling about. You're almost at the server room when you hear one radio in. 
"There's no one here, false alarm. All units, return to your positions."
//Heh, smooth. Maybe not the safest call, but if it works, it works.//]

[[Crawl through to the server room|Server Success]]


:: Server Leeroy Jenkins {"position":"1300,1400","size":"100,100"}
Despite the Captain's warnings, you decide stealth is for pussies. Throwing caution to the wind, you make a mad dash to the server room. You are spotted immediately, and the doors seal on both sides. The blaring alarm signifies enemy forces will arive in mere seconds. //What do I do?//, you ask yourself.
[[There! A vent!|Server Vent]]
[[Guess I'll have to fight my way out!|Server Combat]]


:: Server MGS {"position":"900,1400","size":"100,100"}
You find a large cardboard box in the corner, and judge that it's sufficiently not-human-shaped to fool the camera's software. Just a few steps into the corridor, the captain calls you in a panic.

(click:"calls you")["Scylla, what the hell are you thinking?! Doy you really think that will-"

"Shhhhh. Let me cook, Captain." You indignantly hang up.

(click:"hang up")[You make it through the corridor without incident. Triumphant, you throw off the box, and flip the captain the long-distance bird.

:: Server Pussy {"position":"1100,1600","size":"100,100"}
Suddenly very glad you kept your weapons on you rather than trying to fit through the vent, you methodically knock down each and every single camera in the hall with your pistol. Flaunting their pitiful defenses, you leisurely skip down the hallway as though frolicking through a meadow.

[[Enter the server room|Server Success]]


:: Server Smokes {"position":"900,1600","size":"100,100"}
Undettered by your lack of proper armaments, you decide the smoke grenades you were just able to squeeze through the vent with are all you'll need here. You carefully throw one into the middle of the corridor, and sigh in relief when it covers the whole thing. // Would've really sucked if I had to waste all three here//, you think to yourself. With the cameras sufficiently obscured, you carefully sneak through the smoke, trying not to reveal your position with a cough.

[[Enter the server room|Server Success]]

When you enter the server room, you are flanked by what must be hundreds, maybe thougands of server racks, all covered in rainbow lights. //Gamers//, your face curls in disgust. Walking a bit further into the room, you see a terminal setup that looks like it's from 1968. Figuring that's the primary access pint, you sit down in front of it. Luckily, there's no need to hack it, as the last guy using it forgot to log out. On the desktop are two folders, labelled //Battle Plans// and //Hephaestus//
(click:"Hephaestus")[
Intrigued, you open //Hephaestus//. You see blueprints for an enormous robot, with a cockpit about the size of its hand near the mouth. Worse yet, the tech specs include a high-powered laser under the chin, dozens of turrets al over the body, and enough artillery to level Harlem in a single barrage, with the capacity to switch to chemcal or even nuclear weapons. Estimated production speed: ''17 A DAY?!'' //Man, they weren't kidding when they said they could pulverize the Republic//, you think with a mix of horror and awe. You decide to not waste any more time, and get this info to the Captain ASAP

(click:"the Captain")["Captain, I found the blueprints for the weapon. No time to waste, so I'm transmitting them to you. Read them on your own."

"Wait, Scylla! I need more information! Did you find the plans? What other data did you find?!"

"Over and out, Captain."

(click:"Over and out, Captain")[As you transmit the blueprints and plans, you think of what to do next. The foundry is clearly a more important target, but destroying it would be much easier with explosives from the armory. What do you do?

:: Server Vent {"position":"1500,1400","size":"100,100"}

"Yes, sir. Looking for an entry point."
You are Scylla, an agent of the top-secret Typhon Unit under the Republic of New England. Your mission: Infiltrate a secret base in what was once known as Athens, Ohio. The base has been taken over by unknown militants, and command tells you the base contains the means to destroy the Republic, returning it to the warlord's paradise that most of the former US has become.

Look Around
(click:"Look Around")[You look around with your night vision goggles. In front of you is the back wall of the base. You can see a vent, but it's unclear whether or not you'll fit. There is also a window to a room that seems unoccupied, but they might come back. Of course, there's always the front gate, but it surely can't be that easy, right?

[[Weapon Room]]



:: To Foundry {"position":"1000,2000","size":"100,100"}
You head for the foundry to cripple their ability to build Hephaestus. On arrival, you see the mother of all factories. They have their own steel mill, a microchip fab, and a massive, automated assembly floor. As intimiating as it looks, you spot a fatal flaw: Everything is downhill of the blast furnaces. If one were to fall over, all that molten steel would flood the entire foundry, burying ll that expensive equipment in a giant lump of steel and slag. A few well-placed explosives would do the trick, but you could probably also tip it manually, though it is clearly more dangerous.

The hallway has several security cameras, but no guards. The cameras are not well secured, and could be shot down with a single pistol shot. You get a call from Captain Gorgon.

(click:"call")["Scylla, be careful! The cameras here are linked to a pattern recognition system! If they see anything human-shaped, and their face doesn't match authourized personnel, it'll call a full alert!"

"And who would you be? You know we don't take kindly to outsiders here, right?"

Not bothering to respond, you give him a swift punch to the gut. As he reels, you whip out your rifle and shoot him in the head. His henchmen, shaking in fear, bow their heads to you. You bask in it, as they hail the new Columbus Czar.

After some time, you establish an R&D team, telling them to recreate Hephaestus. They'll take quite a while to do so, and it won't be very high quality, but that's fine. Now, no one will be able to stand in your way.
